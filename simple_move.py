# Purpose:
# This script demonstrates how to move a robot to different positions.

# Hardware setup:
# 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2

# The script does the following:
# 1. Initializes the driver
# 2. Configures the driver
# 3. Opens the gripper
# 4. Moves the arm to a position
# 5. Closes the gripper
# 6. Moves the arm to another position
# 7. The driver automatically sets the mode to idle at the destructor
